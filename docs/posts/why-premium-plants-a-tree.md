# Why Premium Plants a Tree 🌱

Running AI takes energy. We think it is important to acknowledge that — and to do something positive alongside it.

That is why every Premium subscription includes one tree planted each month on your behalf, through our reforestation partner [1clickimpact](https://1clickimpact.com/).

Trees do not change the world overnight. They grow slowly, year by year. But over time, they help restore ecosystems, support biodiversity, and absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Small actions, repeated consistently, matter.

We made this part of Premium because it is easy to do consistently and does not ask anything extra from you.

You will receive a confirmation email from [1clickimpact](https://1clickimpact.com/) when a tree is planted. They handle it directly so the process stays transparent.

It is a small step, but one we think is worth taking. Thank you for being part of it.
