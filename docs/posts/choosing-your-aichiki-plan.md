# Choosing Your AICHIKI Package: A Simple Guide

With a few different ways to use AICHIKI, we wanted to create a clear guide to help you find the best fit. Here’s a simple breakdown of each plan, what it includes, and who it’s best for. We'll also cover the upcoming price changes so you can make an informed choice.
## Premium Subscription: For the Full AICHIKI Experience

The Premium subscription is designed for our regular users. It unlocks the platform's full potential and is the most cost-effective option for frequent use.

**Pricing:**

*   **Current (Until August 31st):**
    *   Monthly: ~$10/month
    *   Yearly: $100/year
*   **From September 1st:**
    *   Monthly: ~$15/month
    *   Yearly: ~$150/year

**Launch Promotion:** Subscribe before September 1st to lock in the current rates. The monthly plan locks for one year, and the yearly plan locks for two years.

**Premium Features:**

*   Access to our best and smartest AI models
*   Unlimited memory across all your conversations
*   Advanced chat settings and customizations
*   A premium frame for your profile picture ✨

**Best for:** If you use AICHIKI regularly, Premium offers the best value and the complete experience. Your support also directly helps us grow and improve the platform.
## Flexible Passes & Boosts

Don't need a full subscription? These options are for more casual or specific use.
### Day Pass: 1 Day ($1) or 3 Days ($2)

Get full Premium access for a short period. We offer two options:

*   **1-Day Pass:** For $1, you get 24 hours of full Premium access.
*   **3-Day Pass:** For $2, you get three full days of access. It's a great value—two extra days for just one extra dollar.

Both passes include the top AI models, unlimited memory in all chats, and all customizations.

**Best for:** Trying out Premium features or for occasional, focused sessions.
### Memory Boost ($1)

This is a targeted upgrade for a single conversation. For $1, you get unlimited memory in one chat thread for three days.

**Important:** This boost **only** provides unlimited memory in one chat; it does not grant access to Premium models or other features. For just $1 more, the **3-Day Pass ($2)** gives you full Premium access across the entire platform for the same duration, which is often a better value.

**Best for:** When you only need perfect recall in a single storyline and don't need any other Premium features.
## Important Note on Pricing & VAT

Please note that all prices listed are base prices. Depending on your country, Value Added Tax (VAT) or other local taxes may be added at checkout. The final price will be displayed before you confirm your payment.
## Our Approach

We offer different plans because we know everyone uses AICHIKI differently. Our goal is to provide flexible options that match your usage style.

We're a small, independent team building this platform. Your support directly covers our primary costs, like the advanced AI models and server infrastructure, and allows us to continue developing new features. We appreciate every member of our community, whether you're here for the free experience or choose to upgrade.

Thanks for reading, and we're glad to have you with us.
