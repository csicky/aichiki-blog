# Choosing Your AICHIKI Plan: A Simple Guide

AICHIKI offers three tiers that give you access to the same creative world, with each one opening a little wider depending on how far you want to take your stories. Here's what each plan offers and how to choose the one that fits your needs.

## Free Tier: Everything You Need to Start Creating

The Free tier is designed to give you a complete AICHIKI experience without any cost. You can dive into unlimited storytelling right from the start.

**What's Included:**

- **Unlimited chats** - Create as many conversations as you want
- **Unlimited character creation** - Build your entire cast of characters
- **Unlimited identity creation** - Switch between different personas
- **Unlimited picture generation** - Visualize your characters and scenes
- **Most chat themes unlocked** - Customize your chat experience
- **Full access to chat settings** - Fine-tune your conversations
- **Group roleplay** - Invite multiple characters into the same chat
- **Access to AICHIKI herself** - Get help from our built-in assistant
- **Limited memory** - Your chats have short-term memory; roleplay continues normally even when older memories fade

**Best for:** Anyone who wants to explore AICHIKI's creative possibilities without commitment. You get unlimited creation and conversation—the only limitation is how far back each character can remember.

## Plus Tier: Unlimited Memory for Your Stories

Plus is perfect if you love the free features but want your characters to remember everything from your conversations, no matter how long ago it happened.

**Pricing:** $3.99/month (plus VAT depending on your country)

**What's Included:**

- **Everything from Free tier**
- **Unlimited memory across all chats** - Characters remember your entire shared history
- **All chat themes unlocked** - Access every visual customization option
- Same AI models as Free tier

**Best for:** Users who want their characters to maintain perfect recall across long, complex storylines without needing Premium's advanced AI models. If you find yourself buying Memory Boosts regularly, Plus offers much better value.

## Premium Tier: The Full AICHIKI Experience

Premium unlocks the platform's full potential with the most advanced AI models and all features. It's our most cost-effective option for regular users who want the deepest, most intelligent conversations.

**Pricing:**

- Monthly: ~$15/month
- Yearly: ~$150/year

**What's Included:**

- **Everything from Plus tier**
- **Higher-quality AI models** - Access to our smartest, most sophisticated conversation models
- **Advanced chat settings and customizations** - Deep control over character behavior
- **Premium profile frame** - A special visual badge for your profile ✨

**Best for:** Regular users who want the complete AICHIKI experience with the most intelligent AI models. Your support directly helps us develop new features and improve the platform.

## Flexible Options: Day Passes & Memory Boosts

Don't need a full subscription? We offer flexible options for casual or specific use.

### Day Pass: 1 Day ($1) or 3 Days ($2)

Get full Premium access for a short period:

- **1-Day Pass:** $1 for 24 hours of complete Premium access
- **3-Day Pass:** $2 for three full days—two extra days for just one extra dollar

Both passes include top AI models, unlimited memory in all chats, and all customizations.

**Best for:** Trying out Premium features or for occasional, focused sessions.

### Memory Boost ($1)

A targeted upgrade for a single conversation. For $1, you get unlimited memory in one chat thread for three days.

**Important:** This **only** provides unlimited memory in one chat; it does not grant access to Premium models or other features. For just $1 more, the **3-Day Pass ($2)** gives you full Premium access across the entire platform for the same duration.

**Consider this:** If you need memory boosts regularly, the **Plus subscription ($3.99/month)** offers unlimited memory across all chats for the entire month—much better value.

**Best for:** When you only need perfect recall in a single storyline and don't need any other Premium features.

## How the Tiers Compare

Think of it as three ways into the same world, each opening a little wider:

- **Free:** Build unlimited worlds with characters that have good short-term memory
- **Plus:** Build unlimited worlds with characters that never forget
- **Premium:** Build unlimited worlds with characters that never forget and have the most sophisticated AI minds

Each tier lets you create without limits. The difference is how deeply characters hold your stories and how strong the models behind them are. You choose how far you want the experience to reach.

## Important Note on Pricing & VAT

All prices listed are base prices. Depending on your country, Value Added Tax (VAT) or other local taxes may be added at checkout. The final price will be displayed before you confirm your payment.

## Our Approach

We offer different plans because we know everyone uses AICHIKI differently. Our goal is to provide flexible options that match your usage style.

We're a small, independent team building this platform. Your support directly covers our primary costs, like the advanced AI models and server infrastructure, and allows us to continue developing new features. We appreciate every member of our community, whether you're here for the free experience or choose to upgrade.

Thanks for reading, and we're glad to have you with us.
