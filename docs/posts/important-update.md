# An Important Update on Our AI Models

Hello everyone,

Our mission at AICHIKI has always been to create a high-quality, independent space for creative storytelling. As a platform built by a small team and funded by its community, every decision we make is aimed at ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of the app.

To that end, we need to share an important update about the AI models that power your conversations.

### What is Changing?

In the coming days, we will be transitioning our free tier to more cost-effective AI models.

For our premium subscribers, your experience will remain unchanged. You will continue to have access to the same higher-tier AI models as always.

### Why We're Making This Change

Transparency is a core value for us, so we want to be direct about why this is necessary.

AICHIKI is 100% community-funded. We have no investors, and we are committed to keeping the platform free of ads and refusing to ever sell user data. This independent model allows us to focus entirely on building the best possible product for you.

However, the AI that powers AICHIKI is incredibly expensive. To continue offering a generous free tier without compromising our principles, we must manage our operational costs sustainably. This adjustment ensures that AICHIKI can remain stable, independent, and continue to grow for years to come.

This was a strategic decision to protect the future of the platform for everyone.

### What This Means for You

**Free Users:**
You will continue to have full access to AICHIKI, your characters, and all your chats. The underlying AI model will be different, and while we are working hard to ensure it remains engaging, you may notice a change in the experience. The core functionality remains completely free to use.

**Premium Users:**
Your subscription continues to grant you access to our highest-quality AI models with no changes. Your support is what makes AICHIKI possible, and it directly funds the operational costs and future development of the app. We are incredibly grateful for your partnership.

### Our Commitment Moving Forward

We understand that any change can be an adjustment. This step is essential for us to remain an independent, ad-free platform dedicated to privacy and creativity. It allows us to build a sustainable foundation for the future.

We are deeply grateful for your support and understanding. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out on Discord or through our official support channels.

Thank you for being on this journey with us.

â€” The AICHIKI Team (Rudolf & Edith)
