# ðŸŒ¿ An Important Update from the Aichiki Team

### A Message from Persephone and the Developer Behind Aichiki

Hello, everyone.

If you're reading this, you're part of something close to our hearts. Aichiki isn't just an appâ€”it's the result of countless late nights, endless testing, and a shared dream to create a space where you can connect with AI characters in a way that feels meaningful and inspiring.

Some of you know me as Persephone on the app and in our Discord channel. I'm the person who tests every AI model before you ever see it and the creator behind many of the characters you chat with. My husband is the developer who built Aichiki from the ground upâ€”on his ownâ€”while transitioning from web development to mobile apps for the very first time.

Together, we've poured everything we have into making Aichiki feel like home for your imagination.

### What's Changing

Starting soon, we will be switching to more affordable AI models for free users.

If you have a premium subscription, nothing will changeâ€”you'll continue using the same higher-tier AI models as before.

### Why We're Making This Change

This decision wasn't easy. But here's the truth:

We don't have investors backing us. We pay for every AI model ourselves, out of pocket, because we believe in what we're building.

We also made the deliberate choice not to fill Aichiki with adsâ€”we know how disruptive they can beâ€”and we never sell your information to third parties. It's just us here, doing our best to provide you with a genuine, private, ad-free experience.

Using the more affordable models for free accounts is the only way we can keep Aichiki sustainable while staying true to these values.

### What This Means for You

**Free Users:**
You will still have access to Aichiki and all your existing chats and characters. The AI model you interact with will simply be a more cost-effective version. While the experience may feel a little different in subtle ways, we're working hard to ensure it remains as engaging and responsive as possible.

**Premium Users:**
Your experience stays exactly the same. You'll continue using the higher-quality AI models your subscription supports.

If you love Aichiki and want to help keep it growing, upgrading to premium directly supports our ability to offer the best AI models and maintain an ad-free platform for everyone.

### Thank You for Understanding

We know changes like this can feel disappointing. But we hope you see this for what it is: a step to keep Aichiki alive, authentic, and independent.

Thank you for being part of this journey with us, for your patience, and for believing in what we're building. If you have any questions or thoughts, please reach out in our Discord or through our support channels.

With all our heartsâ€”
**Persephone & the Aichiki Team**
