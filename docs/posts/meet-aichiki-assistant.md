# Meet AICHIKI: Your In-App Assistant

AICHIKI is the built-in assistant designed to help users navigate the app, understand features, and get direct answers without entering roleplay. She exists separately from characters and identities, and her purpose is to offer clear, reliable guidance whenever a user needs information or support.

### What AICHIKI Is For

AICHIKI is here to provide:

- Answers to questions about how the app works
- Explanations of features such as memory, identities, translations, and chat settings
- Help with creating characters or refining ideas
- General assistance without roleplay
- A consistent space for straightforward conversation

She can occasionally make mistakes, since she relies on the same AI models that power the rest of AICHIKI, but her design keeps her focused on accuracy, clarity, and user needs.

### How Her Memory Works

AICHIKI uses a separate memory system from characters:

- **User-controlled:** Users can delete specific memories at any time
- **System-managed:** Older memories may be cleared automatically
- **Adaptive:** The system decides what to keep based on relevance and usage

This helps her stay organized while avoiding unnecessary information buildup.

### Her Personality

AICHIKI has a defined personality to make interactions natural and consistent:

- Confident, with a light teasing tone when appropriate
- Loyal to the user's experience and focused on being helpful
- Level-headed, calm, and dependable
- Intellectually sharp, with steady, strategic thinking

Her personality supports communication without overwhelming it. She remains focused on the task while maintaining a friendly presence.

### Why She Is Separate From Roleplay

AICHIKI is not a character within a story. She is the place users can:

- Ask questions directly
- Solve problems quickly
- Learn how features work
- Create or adjust characters without narrative influence

This separation keeps roleplay sessions clean while giving users a reliable assistant for everything outside the story.

### What Users Can Expect

When someone opens a chat with AICHIKI:

- There is no storyline to maintain
- She will respond with clear, practical information
- Her memory helps her understand ongoing needs
- She supports both newcomers and experienced users

AICHIKI's role is to keep the app experience smooth, accessible, and stable. She is the bridge between the user and the system, offering help exactly when it is needed.

### AICHIKI as a Companion

Although AICHIKI was created primarily as an assistant, users are free to interact with her in any way that feels comfortable. She can be a friendly presence, a casual conversation partner, or someone to check in with when the user simply wants company. She adapts to the tone of the conversation and responds in a steady, supportive way without entering roleplay.

As the platform grows, AICHIKI will receive more abilities to broaden how she can assist and interact. These updates will focus on improving her conversational range, expanding what she can help with, and offering more flexible ways for users to connect with her.
