# Share AICHIKI and Earn Free Plus Days Together

We built AICHIKI because we believe in meaningful AI conversations and creative storytelling. If you're enjoying the platform, we'd love for you to share it with friends - and we'll reward both of you when you do.

## How the Referral Program Works

The concept is simple: when you share your unique referral code with a friend and they sign up for AICHIKI, you both receive **5 days of Plus access**. It's a genuine win-win.

Your friend gets to experience unlimited memory across all their chats, and you get the same benefit as a thank-you for spreading the word.

## Getting Your Referral Code

Finding and sharing your code takes just a few taps:

1. Open the **Settings** menu in the app
2. Tap on **Referrals**
3. Click **Get My Code** to generate your unique referral code
4. Share it however works best - copy and paste, social media, text message, or email

Your code is permanent and unique to your account, so you only need to generate it once.

## How Your Friend Redeems a Code

When someone signs up using your referral:

1. After creating their account and verifying their email, they'll be prompted to enter a referral code during onboarding
2. They enter the code you shared
3. Both of you receive 5 days of Plus access

Referral codes can only be redeemed once per account, during the onboarding process or shortly after signup.

## Tracking Your Referral Success

Your Referrals dashboard in Settings shows everything you need to know:

- **Your Referral Code:** Your unique code to share with others
- **Total Invites:** How many people have successfully used your code
- **Days Earned:** The total Plus days you've accumulated from referrals
- **Active/Pending Status:** Whether your referral days are currently active or queued for later

## How Referral Days Activate

The way your earned days work depends on your current subscription status.

### If You're on the Free Plan

When someone uses your code, your 5 days of Plus access activate immediately. If you already have active referral days running, they extend by 5 more days. Simple as that.

### If You Have a Paid Subscription

When you have an active paid subscription (monthly or yearly), referral days you earn are queued in the background. They'll automatically activate when your paid subscription ends, giving you a seamless transition:

- Your paid subscription continues uninterrupted
- Referral days stack up while you're subscribed
- When your paid plan expires, all queued referral days activate at once

**Example:** If three friends sign up while you're on a paid plan, you'll have 15 days of Plus queued. When your subscription ends, those 15 days kick in automatically.

## What Plus Access Includes

Referral days provide all the same features as a paid Plus subscription:

- Unlimited messages with characters
- Access to all AI providers
- Priority response times
- Advanced character creation features
- Unlimited memory across all chats
- All chat themes unlocked

The only difference is that referral days are time-limited based on how many successful referrals you've made.

## Program Guidelines

We've kept the rules straightforward to keep things fair for everyone.

### Email Verification Required

Your email must be verified before you can generate a referral code or activate earned referral days. This helps maintain the integrity of the program.

### Real Email Addresses

The referral program is designed for genuine users:

- Use a legitimate email address from providers like Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, Yahoo, ProtonMail, and similar services
- Disposable or temporary email services (the "10 minute mail" variety) aren't compatible with the referral system

This helps us maintain an authentic community of AICHIKI users.

### Simple Rules

- **One code per account:** Each new user can redeem one referral code during signup
- **No self-referrals:** You can't use your own code
- **No limit on sharing:** Invite as many friends as you like and stack up those Plus days

## A Few Things to Keep in Mind

### This is a Marketing Tool

The referral program exists to help AICHIKI grow by rewarding you for introducing friends to the platform. We've designed it to be generous and enjoyable to use.

### The Program May Change

Like any promotional program, we may adjust things over time:

- The number of days granted per referral might change
- The Plus plan or referral program could be modified based on business needs
- We'll do our best to notify you of major changes via email

Think of referral days as a bonus reward for helping AICHIKI grow, rather than a permanent guaranteed benefit.

### Keep It Genuine

The program works best when you share AICHIKI with people who would genuinely enjoy it. Our system is designed to maintain fairness for everyone involved.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I change my referral code?**
No, referral codes are permanent and unique to your account.

**What happens if my friend doesn't verify their email?**
You won't receive your 5 days until they complete email verification. Unverified referrals don't count toward your earned days.

**Do referral days expire?**
No. Once activated, your referral days count down only when you're actively using them. Queued referral days wait patiently until your paid subscription ends.

**Can I combine referral days with a paid subscription?**
Referral days earned while on a paid plan are queued and activate after your subscription ends. They can't run simultaneously with a paid subscription.

**How do I know if my referral code worked?**
Check your Referrals dashboard in Settings - you'll see your total invites and earned days update when someone successfully uses your code.

**Can I use someone else's code if I already have an account?**
No, referral codes can only be redeemed during signup or within a short window after account creation.
