# How to Build a Character With Depth in AICHIKI

Creating a character in AICHIKI is more than selecting a name and a picture. Each character can think, react, and grow through roleplay, and the way you design their personality, history, and style influences how they behave in conversations. I use the same structure every time I build characters for the platform, and you can use it as well, directly through the in-app creator, or with an expanded template I share at the end of this guide.

## How the AICHIKI Character Creator Works

When you start a new character, the app gives you a structured layout to fill in. You can choose a category, write a short description, and expand the main bio. You decide what defines the character: personality, relationships, history, powers, job, or goals.

### 1. Short Description (Visible to Everyone)

This is the first thing anyone sees on your character's page. Think of it as the character's introduction card. You can write it in their voice or in third person, as long as it clearly shows who they are.

**A strong short description highlights:**

- The character's identity or role
- Their core personality
- Anything that makes them interesting right away

Users decide whether to roleplay based on this section, so focus on what matters most.

### 2. Main Bio

After the description, you can expand on the character through the main bio. AICHIKI doesn't restrict how you write it, but depth comes from clarity. You can include:

- Personality traits and values
- Background or history
- World or setting
- Relationships
- Abilities or powers
- Habits, fears, weaknesses, or quirks
- Occupation or lifestyle

The more consistent these details are, the easier it is for the AI to respond as your character. A character with intention behaves like a real individual.

## Writing Personality With Intention

Before you finalize your character, decide what truly drives them.

**Ask yourself:**

- What do they want?
- What do they avoid?
- How do they react to danger, affection, conflict, or stress?
- Which worldview shapes them?
- What contradictions make them interesting?

Depth isn't about writing a long bio. It comes from clear foundations the character always reacts from. Personality is part of that, but it's not the only thing that shapes consistency. A character's backstory affects how they respond to trust, danger, affection, or fear. Relationships matter as well—how they treat strangers is not the same as how they speak to a sibling, a lover, or someone they resent.

A character who grew up in a strict household might respond stiffly to compliments. Someone who lost a friend might cling to new allies or keep them at a distance. Family dynamics, loyalty, trauma, love, culture—these influence behavior just as much as personality traits. Consistency comes from who they are, where they come from, and who they care about.

### 3. Opening Scene (Optional but Powerful)

The opening scene is also visible on the character page. You can leave it blank and let the app generate one, or write your own. I recommend writing it because it sets the tone.

It doesn't need to be a full story. A short moment is enough, showing:

- The character in their environment
- How they think or feel
- The atmosphere around them

This gives users a sense of what it feels like to interact with your character from the start.

### 4. Memories: Giving Your Character a Past

Memories are the most underrated tool inside AICHIKI. You can add them with any plan: Free, Plus, Premium, or Boost. The difference is how they work during roleplay.

**If the user speaking to the character is Premium/Plus/Boost:**

- The character can access all written memories
- They recall them naturally during conversations
- They use them like real personal experiences

**If the user is Free:**

- The character cannot unlock the written memories
- They behave based on the bio and current chat only
- They may improvise fitting "past experiences," but not the exact written ones

I always write 5–10 memories. They give the AI material to work with over time, especially in long roleplays.

### 5. Visuals: Using the Picture Generator

You can upload an image or generate one. If you use the generator, AICHIKI automatically builds a prompt from your character's description and bio. It extracts style, species, clothing elements, and personality mood.

Just wait a moment for the prompt to load, then press generate. You can edit the prompt if you want more control. I use the bio first, then the generator, so the visual matches the personality.

## Optional Resource: Persephone's Expanded Template

I use this template when I want more structure, especially for complex characters. **This is not an official AICHIKI feature**—I created it myself, and I share it here for anyone who wants to use it. You can copy it, adjust it, or simplify it.

### AICHIKI Character Bio Template

## Self Description
(written in first person OR third person)

A straightforward introduction without dramatization. Should state who the character is, how they think, what defines them, and what their role in life is.

## Memories (5–15 entries)

Each memory starts with "I remember…" and should be written as a personal recollection.

Example:
- I remember the first time I saw snow fall—I stood in the courtyard for hours, watching each flake settle on my hands.
- I remember my mentor's final words before they left: "Trust your instincts, even when logic fails you."

Shows the character in their natural environment or neutral ground for both character and user, focusing on atmosphere and personality.

```

## Create With Confidence

AICHIKI gives you the tools. This template helps you push deeper whenever you want to. Start simple or build complex worlds—your character will still have personality, memory, and room to grow.

If you ever need help writing any section, refining traits, or building memories, you can ask AICHIKI.
