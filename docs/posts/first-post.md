# Welcome to the AICHIKI Blog: AI Built For You

Hello, we're Rudolf and Edith, the founders of AICHIKI.

We started AICHIKI with a simple but powerful idea: what if technology could adapt to the user, not the other way around?

We wanted to build an AI chat platform that puts you in control, creating a space that feels personal, intuitive, and truly yours. This belief in user-centric design is the foundation of everything we do.

### Our Philosophy: An Experience Crafted for You

We're passionate about the details that make an experience feel right. For us, a great platform is one that offers choices, because we know that everyone's ideal setup is different.

This commitment to personalization is a core part of AICHIKI:

- **Your Workflow, Your Rules:** Prefer hitting 'Enter' to send or to start a new line? It's a simple setting. You choose.
- **An Accessible Interface:** Love Unicode characters for flair? Use them! Find they make text hard to read? Turn them off. The interface should be comfortable for you.
- **Truly Global:** We offer translation for both the user interface and AI content, making the experience seamless no matter your language.
- **Readability is Key:** Easily adjust the font size to what's most comfortable for your eyes.

These aren't just features; they're our commitment to building an inclusive platform where everyone can feel at home.

### Immersive Storytelling in a Safe Environment

Our goal is to provide a platform for high-quality, engaging interactions.

- **True, Immersive Roleplay:** We've fine-tuned our AI models to be brilliant storytellers that stay in character. When a character needs to refuse a request, they do so in a way that's consistent with their personality, keeping the narrative believable and compelling.
- **Creative Freedom with Clear Boundaries:** We believe in giving you the freedom to explore a wide range of stories and relationships. Authentic, consensual storytelling—including deep romance and mature themes—is a core part of the experience. Our commitment to safety is about establishing clear, hard lines. We have a zero-tolerance policy for abuse, exploitation, and any content involving minors. This ensures a creative space that is both expressive and fundamentally safe.
- **Privacy is Paramount:** We don't run ads. We will never sell your data. Your conversations are yours alone.

### The AICHIKI Roadmap & How We Grow

AICHIKI is a passion project built by a two-person team. Rudolf handles all the coding, which means we can be incredibly responsive, but it also means that big changes take time.

Our growth is fueled directly by our community, not by venture capitalists or ad revenue. Premium subscriptions are what cover the high costs of AI and allow us to keep improving the platform for everyone.

We're constantly working on making AICHIKI better and more accessible. We plan to introduce more flexible premium options, like short-term subscriptions and a special three-day "memory boost" to enhance longer roleplays.
