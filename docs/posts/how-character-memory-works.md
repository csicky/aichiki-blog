# How Character Memory Works

Aichiki helps your AI characters remember your conversations naturally and stay consistent throughout your chats. We offer two levels of memory depending on your plan.

## How Conversations Are Organized

Your chats are automatically organized into conversation segments based on how long you've been talking (roughly 24 messages, or after 48 hours of inactivity).

When a segment ends, we create a summary of what happened and start fresh with your most recent messages to keep things flowing smoothly.

Your current ongoing messages are always available so the character knows exactly where you left off.

## Free Plan Memory (Recent History)

With the free plan, characters remember:

- **Your active conversation** - all the messages you're currently exchanging
- **Recent history** - summaries of your last 3 conversation segments

Think of it like having a good short-term memory. The character will remember what you talked about recently and can reference things from your last few chats, but older conversations naturally fade away.

## Premium Memory (Full Recall)

When you subscribe or use a memory boost, characters unlock deeper memory:

- **Smart recall** - the character can remember details from way back in your conversation history, even from weeks or months ago
- **Relevant memories** - when you mention something specific, the character automatically recalls related past conversations
- **Character backstory** - some characters come with pre-loaded memories that make them feel more authentic from the start
- **Unlimited archives** - your old conversation summaries are preserved instead of being forgotten

Instead of just remembering the last few chats, premium characters can pull up relevant details from your entire conversation history. If you mentioned your dog's name three months ago, a premium character can recall it when you bring up your pet again.

**Important note:** To bring an old memory back into the active conversation, you need to mention or reference it in your message. For example, if you want the character to remember a trip you discussed last month, you might say "Remember that trip to Paris we talked about?" The character will then search through the archived memories and pull up the relevant details. Think of it like jogging someone's memory - they have the information stored, but you need to give them a hint about what you want them to recall.

## How It Switches Automatically

You don't need to do anything to activate these features:

- **Starting out:** Every new conversation begins with basic recent memory
- **Upgrading:** When you subscribe or activate a memory boost, your current conversations automatically gain full recall ability
- **Instant activation:** The enhanced memory works immediately - no setup required
- **Always learning:** As you continue chatting, the character builds a richer understanding of your relationship

The switch is completely seamless. Free users enjoy natural short-term continuity, while premium users get characters that can recall your entire shared history together. It all happens behind the scenes, so you can just focus on having great conversations.
